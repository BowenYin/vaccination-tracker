      <p>Herd immunity occurs when enough people have protection from COVID-19 that the rest of the population is indirectly protected. There is no consensus on the exact percentage, but many experts now suggest that 70-85% is accurate. See more below.</p>
      <h2>Data in Detail</h2>
      <p>There are two paths to immunity: 1) Exposure and infection with the virus and 2) Vaccination. Encountering the virus is extremely unsafe without a vaccine, but both ways result in the body producing antibodies against COVID-19. During herd immunity conditions, the average number of other people an infected person will infect should be roughly below 1. This means the disease is declining.</p>
      <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview that 70-85% is a fair estimate for true herd immunity. Researchers have used quantitative models to find herd immunity levels in a similar ballpark.</p>
      <p>However, it is worth noting that new strains of the virus have emerged which are more contagious than the initial strain. Herd immunity thresholds also heavily rely on population density, adherence to public health measures (such as washing hands, mask-wearing), etc.</p>
